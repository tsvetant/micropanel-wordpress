### Description

**NEW** Now with the launch of v2 of our Micropanel there are a lot of changes, but the thing we've kept is our main concept - same minimalistic and classy outfit. The coding part is now optimized better looking and removed some of the old options for the new one that are going to replace them. The Micropanel is now compatible with the latest WordPress **3.8.x** version !  

Micropanel is clean and unique WP Admin Template. With simple installation and user-friendly interface it distracts your from the boring default administration presented by WordPress. With the latest version Micropanel is now **Responsive** and includes extended options and customization. We've kept the main WordPress Admin Theme concept without retouching anything else than styling and adding new features.
